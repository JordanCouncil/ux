	<h1>Research, Design, + Playtime</h1>
	<br>

	<p>Hi Heather!</p>
	<p>I wanted to put everything in a beautiful, elephantine PDF file but feel a structured email might be a little quicker to make, manage, and review.</p>
	<p>Let's start with some web designs.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p><strong>WEB DESIGN</strong>: More about learning function than form, or rather code than design, these sites were still fun to make in Jen's class.
		<ul>
			<li>School of Usability: <a href="https://jordancouncil.github.io/uikit/index.html ">https://jordancouncil.github.io/uikit/index.html </a></li> 
			<li>Untethered Motion: <a href="https://jordancouncil.github.io/rwd2/index.html ">https://jordancouncil.github.io/rwd2/index.html</a></li>
				<ul><li>This includes the photography that I wanted to show you.</li></ul>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<br>
	<p><strong>UX RESEARCH</strong>: I work with personas, lab participants (classmates and friends), and markups (Balsamiq) to critique BitMidi and Spotify.
		<ul>
			
			<li>A Medley of UX - content creation, microcopy, persona journeys, wireframes, and comparative scenario testing: </li>
			<br>
				<ul><li><embed src="UX-Research.pdf" width="750px" height="800px" /></li></ul>
		</ul>
		
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>A Spotify critique based on lab participant feedback using the KJ Method: </li>
			<br>
				<ul><li><embed src="UX-KJMethod.pdf" width="750px" height="800px" /></li></ul>
		</ul>

		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>My end-of-semester oral presentation slides critiquing BitMidi (So fun!): </li>
			<br>
				<ul><li><embed src="UX-Presentation.pdf" width="750px" height="800px" /></li></ul>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<br>
	<p><strong>DRAWING</strong>: I intended to include other drawings, but they are currently needles in the haystack of my photo library. 

		<br>
		<ul>
		<li>My Untethered Motion Logo</li><br>
		<ul><li><embed src="UntetheredMotion.jpeg" width="400px" height="400px" /></li></ul>
		</ul>
	</p>
		
	<br>
	<p><strong>PLAYTIME</strong>: My favorite pastimes tend to relate to unique user designs. 

		<br>
		<ul>
		<li>My keyboard layout has been Dvorak for almost 5 years now:</li><br>
		<ul><li><embed src="Dvorak_Layout.png" width="1000px" height="350px" /></li><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Moving the most frequently used letters of the English language to the home row makes a Zen-like typing experience.</li> 
				<li>I found typing this way to be quieter and quicker with less effort.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		</ul>

		<br>
		<ul>
		<li>I styled, drilled, sawed, and equipped my van, Monkey D. Luffy (LEW-fee), with racks, steel bumpers, awning, tent, tires, etc...

		<ul><br>
			<li><embed src="SwissLuffy.jpeg" width="525px" height="400px" /></li>
			<ul><br>
				<li>It's like a Swiss army knife that contracts and expands. </li> 
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>
		</ul>

		<br>

		<ul>

		<li>I really enjoy the user experience of old/manual cameras (Leica, Fujifilm x-series, etc...) and vehicles too, apparently. The tactile controls, and the human error of manual dials, increase the effort required to take each shot but also the personal satisfaction of capturing stunning images.<br>
		<ul><br>
		<li><embed src="Leica.jpeg" width="525px" height="400px" /></li>
		</li>
		</ul>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<ul>
		<li>For years I desired to play the organ anywhere I wanted. I found that the virtual chromatic button accordion was a great solution.
		<ul><br>
		<li><embed src="AccordionLayout.jpg" width="525px" height="400px" /></li>
		</ul>
		
		</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>CONCLUSION: 

		<ul>
			<li>That was fun to write, and I hope it has what you have requested and more. I'd be happy to follow-up on any of the material and will be standing by incase a file fails to format, or otherwise open, properly.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>Best wishes, <br> Jordan</p>
